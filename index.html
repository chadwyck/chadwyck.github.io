<p>This website is currently being developed.  Soon there will be all sorts of wonderful links and things!  In the meantime, check out a few of my projects that I've worked on, a screenshot of a project I'm currently working on, and my resume!  So much fun to be had!</p>

<p>Last summer I had the chance to work on an awesome project with BP3 Global in Austin, Texas creating an easy-to-use UI builder for Business Process Management user tasks running in the open-source Activiti BPM engine.  The result was beyond any of our expectations at the beginning of the summer.  Running as a Node.js web application with a customizable, responsive, Bootstrap-based interface, the UI builder gave an out-of-the-box webserver to run tasks and a drag-and-drop interface to create UI's for tasks.  Check out BP3's post about the project <a href="http://www.bp-3.com/blogs/2013/08/brazos-for-activiti-including-video/">here</a>.</p> 

<p>Check out the development overview video below.</p>

<p>I am currently working on an exciting project with a few of my friends that is a niche music website that allows musicians to easily collaborate with each other.  I'll post a link to the prototype site as soon as we have a prototype up.  Below is a screenshot of the project so far.</p>
